## How does this App work?

```{r}
library(datasets)
data <- esoph

age <- "45-54"          # 45-54 years old
alc <- "0-39g/day"      # 0-2 drinks per day
tob <- "0-9g/day"       # 0-9 cigarettes per day

tmp <- data[data$agegp == age & data$alcgp == alc & data$tobgp == tob, ]

cases <- sum(as.numeric(tmp$ncases))
total <- cases + sum(as.numeric(tmp$ncontrols))

paste("Among people like you,", cases, "out of", total, 
      "had esophogeal cancer.")
```
